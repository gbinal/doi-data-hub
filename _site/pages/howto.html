<p>“Open data means taking data that is sitting in the vaults of the government, that the taxpayers have already paid for, and jujistu-ing it into the public domain as machine-readable fuel for entrepreneurship and innovation.” – Todd Park, U.S. Chief Technology Officer</p>

<h4 id="what-is-open-data">What is Open Data?</h4>

<p>Open data is data that is freely available to everyone to use and republish for their own purposes. In the context of government open data, this means that Departments should adopt a presumption in favor of openness to the extent permitted by law and subject to privacy, confidentiality, security, or other valid restrictions.</p>

<p>Open data is managed and provided in a way that makes it understandable and usable. The government’s (and taxpayer’s) investment in data therefore becomes an an asset that can be used and reused for maximum return inside and outside of government. Learn more about what government is doing to make this happen, and join the conversation, at <a href="http://project-open-data.github.io/">Project Open Data</a>.</p>

<h4 id="looking-for-doi-data">Looking for DOI data?</h4>

<p>Look no further! Search for and discover DOI data and data products at our <a href="http://data.doi.gov/">data.doi.gov beta data catalog</a>! Please note that our catalog was recently launched on November 30, 2013. Expect constant improvement over the next few months as we work out issues and respond to feedback. DOI data is also available (along with data from other Federal departments) at <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a>.</p>

<h4 id="have-a-data-suggestion-for-us">Have a data suggestion for us?</h4>

<p>We welcome your feedback, and have started a space for you to suggest ideas, comment on other ideas, and rank what you think is important. Head over to <a href="http://usinterior.ideascale.com/">usinterior.ideascale.com</a> and leave us a note. We’re especially interested in hearing what datasets you’d like to see that would serve you or your business better.</p>

<h4 id="the-doi-fy14-open-data-plan">The DOI FY14 Open Data Plan</h4>

<p>In the FY14 Open Data Plan for the Department of the Interior (DOI), we present our objectives, approach, and quarterly action plan for the fiscal year. In order to make our data assets more open and available, DOI has been building a Data Services Team and setting up basic processes and infrastructure (such as the DOI Enterprise Data Inventory at data.doi.gov), and collaborating with business and mission staff. Just like our business and programmatic data, our Departmental data teams and business subject matter experts in business programs, Bureaus and Offices are our most important strategic assets. During this process, DOI Bureaus and Offices have collaborated very closely, working together and helping each other. The DOI Open Data Initiative bridges our business, data management and IT programs – <strong>together we are working to discover the true value of data.</strong></p>

<p>View our plan <a href="../assets/docs/DOIOpenDataFY14Plan.pdf">here</a> (pdf).</p>

<h4 id="editing-content">Editing content</h4>

<p>There are two types of content: pages and posts (or news items). Posts are discussed next.</p>

<p>To edit existing pages, navigate to the <code>pages</code> directory in your project’s root. Edit
the files in your editor of choice.  These are written in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>.</p>

<p>If your site is hosted at GitHub using <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> you can edit the content
directly or you can use <a href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a>.</p>

<h4 id="creating-news-items">Creating News Items</h4>

<p>To create a <em>new</em> post, copy the <code>_posts/post-template.md</code> file to the same directory and use this
file naming convention: <code>YYYY-MM-DD-Your-Post-Title.md</code>.  Edit that file accordingly and it 
will automatically be displayed on the the <a href="news.html">news page</a>.  </p>

<h4 id="adding-new-pages">Adding new pages</h4>

<p>Copy the <code>pages/page_template.md</code> file to <code>pages/your_file_name.md</code> and add content as desired.</p>
