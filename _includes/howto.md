#### Looking for DOI data?

Look no further! Search for and discover DOI data and data products at the [DOI beta data catalog](http://data.doi.gov/)! Please note that our catalog was recently launched on November 30, 2013. Expect constant improvement over the next few months as we work out issues and respond to feedback. DOI data is also available (along with data from other Federal departments) at [data.gov](http://www.data.gov/).

#### The DOI FY14 Open Data Plan

In the FY14 Open Data Plan for the Department of the Interior (DOI), we present our objectives, approach, and quarterly action plan for the fiscal year. In order to make our data assets more open and available, DOI has been building a Data Services Team and setting up basic processes and infrastructure (such as the DOI Enterprise Data Inventory at data.doi.gov), and collaborating with business and mission staff. Just like our business and programmatic data, our Departmental data teams and business subject matter experts in business programs, Bureaus and Offices are our most important strategic assets. During this process, DOI Bureaus and Offices have collaborated very closely, working together and helping each other. The DOI Open Data Initiative bridges our business, data management and IT programs -- **together we are working to discover the true value of data.**
